# Autoencoder-for-learning-unsupervised-representations
An auto-encoder consists of a bi-directional LSTM encoder and a uni-directional LSTM for decoder to learn the unsupervised representations of a text.

Calculated the reconstruction loss and BLEU score for autoencoder model.
Also analyzed the autoencoder model using teacher forcing.
Using the unsupervised representations of a text given by the autoencoder model, we analyzed and compare the performance of logistic regression model and a LSTM model with same architecture as the encoder in autoencoder architecture.
